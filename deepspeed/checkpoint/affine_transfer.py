"""Plan a parameter move between two affine shardings without rebuilding the parameter.

``affine.py`` describes where one rank's block of a parameter lives on both sides of a shard, and
``rebuild``/``extract`` act on that description through the full tensor. This module composes two
descriptions -- the map the bytes were sharded by and the map they are being sharded into -- into
copies that go straight from a source shard to a target shard, so no rank has to address the full
parameter at any point.

Direction is the easy thing to get wrong here. A piece's ``source_*`` addresses the full logical
tensor and its ``dest_*`` addresses the shard holding it, so the read address of a source piece is
its ``dest_*``, not its ``source_*``. Every address this module emits points into a shard, and
offsets and strides are elements, as ``torch.as_strided`` takes them. Converting to bytes belongs to
whatever moves them.

Only ``scale == 1`` is planned. A scaled piece is invertible on its own, but an Adam resume under a
scale also needs its learning rate and epsilon carried into the other coordinate, which is geometry
this file does not own -- so it is refused here for the same reason ``affine.py`` refuses it.

Nothing here is allocated per element, which is why ``ParamAffineMap.validate_coverage`` is never
called: it walks every element of the parameter by design. Coverage is argued over pieces instead,
and ``_covers_exactly`` states what that argument does and does not buy.
